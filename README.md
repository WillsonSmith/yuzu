## Details

### Why

> There are a thousand options for building websites! Why would you build this?

This is highly tailored to what I need it to be so I never have to fight my build system. If there is something missing, or something that feels clunky, I can change it. 

### How to use

* Build websites and web applications in the [web](https://github.com/WillsonSmith/yuzu/tree/main/web) folder
* Build browser extensions in the [extension](https://github.com/WillsonSmith/yuzu/tree/main/extension) folder
